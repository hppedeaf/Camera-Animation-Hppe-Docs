### ◆ Description:

Before, there was a VRChat mod called 'Camera Animation.' However, VRChat removed all mods, and everyone felt sad and missed it, just like how I feel. I love those mods, so I decided to recreate it exactly like the original. Plus, I added a few features that the original Camera Animation mod didn't have.

Camera Animation is for making videos or movies, or anything you want to do with video streams.

Please don’t forget tag #CAHppe on any Social Media such as Tik-tok, Twitter, etc. I want to see what you made for the video. It’ll make me happy to see. ♡

<ins>**!!! This is only for PC version, and can't Quest version because of this Camera Animation require need to use constraints to make it work. !!!**</ins>
<p></p>

<ins>**!!! Desktop Mode isn't support yet (will add in the future) !!!**</ins>
<p></p>

<ins>**!!! For anyone who doesn't understand the difference between 'full system' and 'full system + support.' !!!**</ins>
:::note

"They are the same version; there is no difference. The second one with support just adds extra cost as a contribution."

:::
<ins>**!!! this package don't have VRCLens !!!**</ins>
:::note

"You can use Camera Animation without VRCLens but if you want CA linked with VRCLens, you need get it from their Gumroad"

:::danger
**! ! ! Ensure set behaviour on VRC Camera “look at me” when using Camera Animation ! ! !**
Because the Camera Animation is connected to a VRC Camera, that need to look at your face.
