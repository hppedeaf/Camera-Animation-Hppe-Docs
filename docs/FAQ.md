### Who made that CAHppe?
hppedeaf is the creator of Camera Animation Hppe.

My name is hppedeaf, I'm Deaf and from French. I’m the creator of Camera Animation Hppe. The inspiration for it came from the original Camera Animation mod for VRChat, which was removed a year ago. I decided to bring it back to life! ♡

I’ve had so much help with writing in English and creating tutorial videos from TachDeaf. Here's her message:

Hi, I’m TachDeaf! I'm deaf and from Britain. I help hppedeaf with English translation, and I write on the CAHppe website with some tutorials and explanations about what it does. _Note: I didn’t create CAHppe, hppedeaf did that herself._ ♡

### How do I linked VRClens with CA?
There's a tutorial video on how to link VRCLens with CA as a plugin. Please check the [Installation](Installations/With%20VRCLens)

If you've followed the video tutorial but it still doesn't work, make sure to check the animation with DynVR. If all text are yellow except for one that is white, it should be working.

### CAHppe camera doesn't appear, glitches, or turns on and off repeatedly in the VRC Camera. What did I do wrong?
You need to set your VRC Camera behavior to 'look-at-me.' That should fix it.
:::danger important

**⚠️ Ensure set behaviour on VRC Camera “look at me” when using Camera Animation ⚠️**

Because the Camera Animation is connected to a VRC Camera, that need to look at your face.

### When I use force in the VRC Camera, I can see silhouette that interfeeres in the focus layer of the camera.
That is the problem with VRC Camera, if you want making video look beautiful with focus, I would recommended you to using VRCLens or VirtualLens2 to linked with CAHppe.

Please check the VRClens or VirtualLens2 linked in [installation](Installations/With%20VRCLens) and [How to use](How%20To%20Use/VRCLens)
